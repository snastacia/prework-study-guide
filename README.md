Boot Camp Pre-work Study Guide for Students

## Description

The goal of this project was to create a comprehensive study guide for students to refer to throughout the course of this coding bootcamp. 

This was achieved by pulling together basic concepts on key topics such as HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript via an easy to navigate browser. 

Students will be able to refer back to key points as they work through new projects and assignemts with ease, saving them hours of scrolling through weeks and months worth of notes and previously completed modules. 

Through working on this project, I was able to solidify the basics of coding using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which will ultimately help me excel in my future career as a software engineer. I was also able to practice using Github, which will make it easie to collabrate and work with my peers moving forward.
